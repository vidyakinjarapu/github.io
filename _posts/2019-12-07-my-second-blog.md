The Serum Institute of India (SII) on Sunday became the first indigenous company to apply to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation for the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine in the country, citing unmet medical needs due to the pandemic and in the interest of the public at large, official sources said.

A day earlier, the Indian arm of U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer became the first to seek a similar approval from Indiaâ€™s drug regulator for its own COVID-19 vaccine in the country, after securing such clearance in the UK and Bahrain.

The phase-3 clinical trial of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, is being conducted by the Pune-based SII, co-sponsored by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in various parts of the country in addition to clinical studies being carried out by Oxford-AstraZeneca in the UK and Brazil.
